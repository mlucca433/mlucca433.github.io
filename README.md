            <h2>Zebras</h2>

            <p>Zebras are fascinating animals known for their distinctive black and white striped coat. They belong to the horse family and are native to various parts of Africa. Zebras are social animals and are often found in groups, known as dazzles, for protection against predators.</p>
            <p>There are three main species of zebras: the plains zebra, the Grevy's zebra, and the mountain zebra. Each species has its unique characteristics, but they all share the iconic black and white stripes that make them easily recognizable.</p>
            <p>Zebras are herbivores and primarily graze on grass. Their stripes are believed to serve as a form of camouflage, helping them blend into their grassland habitats and providing protection from predators.</p>

            <h2>Habitat</h2>
            <img src="zebra2.jpg" alt="Zebra Habitat Image">
            <p>Zebras inhabit various types of ecosystems, from savannas and grasslands to woodlands and coastal hills. They are well-adapted to different environments and can be found in both hot and cold climates. Zebras often migrate in search of food and water, covering long distances during their annual migrations.</p>
            <p>These animals have a keen sense of hearing and sight, which helps them detect predators early. They form strong social bonds within their groups and rely on communal defense strategies to ward off threats from predators like lions and hyenas.</p>
            <p>Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting zebra habitats and ensuring the survival of these unique and beautiful creatures in the wild.</p>

            <h2>Conservation</h2>
            <img src="zebra3.jpg" alt="Zebra Conservation Image">
            <p>Zebras, like many other wildlife species, face threats to their survival due to habitat loss, poaching, and climate change. Conservation organizations work tirelessly to protect and preserve zebra populations by implementing measures to safeguard their natural habitats and prevent illegal hunting.</p>
            <p>Education and awareness campaigns are also essential in promoting the conservation of zebras and their ecosystems. Supporting wildlife reserves and sanctuaries that focus on zebra conservation is one way individuals can contribute to the protection of these magnificent animals.</p>
            <p>By working together, we can ensure a future where zebras continue to roam freely in the wild, contributing to the rich biodiversity of our planet.</p>
